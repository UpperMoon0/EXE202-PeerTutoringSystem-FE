# Peer Tutoring System

This project aims to be a leading national platform connecting university students with high-quality, reliable peer tutors. Our mission is to empower students with accessible, affordable, and secure tutoring solutions. We address several key problems: parents struggling to find certified tutors due to limited local options; unreliable online platforms where tutors may cancel frequently or lack expertise; high tutoring fees in urban areas making one-on-one lessons inaccessible; and the lack of a centralized platform, forcing students and parents to juggle multiple websites and apps to locate, schedule, and review tutors.
